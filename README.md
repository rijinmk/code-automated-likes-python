# Introduction
This is a python script that is used to automate the process of liking all the post on specific hashtag(s). This is mainly to gain more followers from the same field of interest. This script uses the following libraries: 

* Selenium 
  To automate the process. 
* Time (built-in)
  To give delay to some processes.

If your internet is fast enough you can like upto 2000+ posts in 1 hour. But we have to keep some delay with `time.delay()` to reduce of the risk of getting blocked.
